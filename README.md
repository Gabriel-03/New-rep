# Best movie
The best movie I saw in the summer was A requiem for a dream. Its about a NYC MOm and Son who both have the same goal of making it out of their crappy small house and get rich. The mom applies to appear in her fav tv game show and the son wants to make a clothing company. Slowly they both end up being consumed by drugs and end up in hospital.
